This will be replaced with docs soon-ish. 
I'll use this to take notes on the less obvious stuff.

=====

EFCore Create Migration:
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --project .\InhouseCore.Persistence.Sqlite\ --startup-project .\InhouseCore.Web\Server\

=====

EFCore Sqlite Provider can't create folders
In my environment I use

    "SqliteConnectionString": "DataSource=.\\_debug\\TestInhouseLeague.db",

I had to manually create _debug folder in InhouseCore.Web.Server (Startup Project) Directory and exclude from source control

=====

Had to add development key to appsettings.json

  "IdentityServer": {
    "Clients": {
      "InhouseCore.Web.Client": {
        "Profile": "IdentityServerSPA"
      }
    },
    "Key": {
      "Type": "Development"
    }
  }
